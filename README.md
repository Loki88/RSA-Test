RSA-Test
========

Simple implementation of the protocol RSA for the course of combinatory and cryptography


________

v 1.0

Alice and Bob can communicate and nobody's listening their messages.

________

v 1.1

Installed numpy to speed computation.



Requirements:

- Python 3

- Numpy

	Ubuntu:
	sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib ipython ipython-notebook python-pandas python-sympy python-nose

________________

v 1.1a

System completed.

- Alice and Bob can comunicate on a secure channel.
- Alice shares her public key. She's generated this key with a criteria that could be not secure. Eva tries to factorize key mod.
- Try to generate primes of any size.
- Customize every part of this system choosing between some factorization methods and primality test. Choose minimum key lenght and attack Alice.
